/* Loop invariant explanation:


Initialization: There are no elements prior to 0, therefore all are not 0
Maintenance: At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the elements before i are all NOT equivalent to v
Termination: If an element == v, the loop terminates, therefore everything before that index was !=v. 
Or, if no element was == v, the loop terminates, therefore nothing was == v.*/
